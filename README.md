# Group-4-Project-1
UPenn Data Science Bootcamp Project 1

The Group-4-Project-1 Repository contains an analysis of real estate pricing trends in Philadelphia and 4 other similarly sized cities: Phoenix, San Diego, San Antonio, and Dallas. It reveals the curious interplay of socio-economic, demographic, and geographic factors that impact the housing market including, but not limited to, home values, time to sale, and number of properties available. This can provide valuable insights for stakeholders to inform housing market interventions and promote sustainable growth in cities.

## Goal
Our goal of the project was to investigate the relationship between various factors related to the housing market and the local economy. Our project was aimed to explore the various factors that contribute to the state of the housing market in different cities, and to understand how these factors are related to each other. This was achieved by analyzing datasets of the differnet variables that describe a current housing market state for each city and to compare them as a group to help us come to a conclusion on a decision related to housing and economic development.

### Data analyzed:
Unemployment Rates
Race of Homeowners
Age of Homeowners
Education of Homeowners
Home Values per City
Average List Prices per City
Housing Sale Prices per City
Number of New Monthly Listings per City
